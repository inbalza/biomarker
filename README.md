# Biomarker
Traineeship project - creation of a knowledge graph for biomarker-disease associations

## Description
Biomarkers, or biological markers, refer to a broad subcategory of medical signs. They are objective and quantifiable characteristics of biological processes. Though already used in clinical trials, biomarker data vary widely between different resources.
The aim of this project is to help unifying biomarker information by creating a light ontology (OWL) model and applying it on data from different sources.
